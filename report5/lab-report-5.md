Intro

This lab report is an extension to lab report 3, which I researched on the `grep` command line options. 

In this lab report, I am researching on the `find` command line options. I chose this this lab report topic because it is interesting to see how useful the terminal commands are and learning this would help me access my files easier and faster.

Examples of them would be provided using the files and directories from ./written_2 provided in class.
